***Global Job Satisfaction Survey Visualization Project***

**Overview**

This project involves the creation of an insightful and interactive Power BI dashboard based on a survey conducted across multiple countries to assess job satisfaction and related factors. The project transforms raw survey data into actionable insights, allowing users to explore global job satisfaction trends and understand key factors influencing employee sentiment. This project highlights my ability to use Power BI for data modeling, advanced visualization, and dynamic dashboard creation.

**Project Workflow**

**Data Integration and Preparation:**

**Importing Data:** The survey data was imported from the Excel workbook titled "Power BI - Final Project.xlsx" into Power BI. The dataset contains responses from participants across various countries, capturing critical metrics like job satisfaction levels, work-life balance, job security, and more.

**Data Cleaning:** Conducted data cleaning processes to ensure the dataset's accuracy and consistency. This included handling missing data, correcting data types, and standardizing categorical variables to facilitate effective analysis.

**Data Modeling:**

**Data Relationships:** Established relationships between different tables in the dataset, ensuring a robust and accurate data model. This structure allowed for efficient cross-tabulation and analysis of the survey results across various dimensions.

**Calculated Columns and Measures:** Developed calculated columns and measures to derive key performance indicators, such as average satisfaction scores, percentage distributions, and other critical metrics, enabling deeper insights into the survey data.

**Data Visualization:**

**Clustered Bar Chart:** Visualized the distribution of job satisfaction levels across different countries and job roles. This visualization helped in comparing satisfaction across regions and understanding which factors contributed most to employee sentiment.

**Pie Chart:** Illustrated the proportion of employees satisfied versus dissatisfied with specific job aspects, including salary, work environment, and career growth opportunities.

**Stacked Bar Chart:** Used to display the breakdown of job satisfaction levels within specific countries, allowing for a comparison of multiple factors within each region.

**Map Visualization:** A filled map that geographically represents the global distribution of survey respondents, with color coding to indicate varying levels of job satisfaction across different countries.

**Dashboard Creation:**

**Interactive Dashboard:** All visualizations were compiled into a comprehensive Power BI dashboard. The dashboard is designed to provide a holistic view of global job satisfaction trends, with interactive features that allow users to filter and drill down into specific countries, job roles, or satisfaction factors.

**Slicers:** Implemented slicers for dynamic filtering, enabling users to interactively adjust the data displayed on the dashboard, such as selecting specific countries, job roles, or survey categories.

**Page Navigation Buttons:** Added page navigation buttons for a seamless user experience, allowing easy navigation between different report pages within the dashboard.

**Data Refresh and Updates:**

**Automated Data Refresh:** Configured the Power BI report to automatically refresh the data, ensuring the dashboard always reflects the most up-to-date survey results.

**Scalable Design:** The data model and dashboard are structured to accommodate new survey data, making it easy to update and maintain the dashboard as new information becomes available.

**Key Features**

**Advanced Data Analysis:** Demonstrates proficiency in cleaning, modeling, and visualizing complex survey data using Power BI.

**Detailed Visualizations:** Includes a variety of visualizations such as Clustered Bar Charts, Pie Charts, Stacked Bar Charts, and Map Visualizations to provide in-depth insights into global job satisfaction.

**Interactive Dashboard:** A fully interactive and customizable dashboard with slicers and navigation buttons, allowing users to explore the data from multiple perspectives.

**Global Insights:** The project offers a global perspective on job satisfaction, making it valuable for organizations with a diverse, international workforce.

**Conclusion**

This project showcases my expertise in using Power BI to transform complex datasets into meaningful, interactive visualizations and dashboards. The project highlights my ability to deliver data-driven insights that support decision-making processes, particularly in the context of global HR analytics and workforce management. This project is an excellent demonstration of my capabilities in a data-focused role, where advanced visualization and interactive reporting are essential.
